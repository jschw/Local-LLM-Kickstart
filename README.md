# chatshell

> **A conversational shell for local AI workflows**

`chatshell` is an open‑source, local‑first AI middleware that turns chat into a **control plane** for large language models, tools, and data.

With `chatshell`, conversations are not just messages - they are **commands** that can retrieve context, invoke tools, orchestrate agents, and automate workflows.
