# chatshell

> **A conversational shell for local AI workflows**

`chatshell` is an open‑source, local‑first AI middleware that turns chat into a **control plane** for large language models, tools, and data.

Think of it as:

* a **shell**, not a chatbot
* a **workflow engine**, not a SaaS
* a **local daemon**, not a cloud dependency

With `chatshell`, conversations are not just messages — they are **executable threads** that can retrieve context, invoke tools, orchestrate agents, and automate workflows.
